                Dream Perfect Regime, popularly known as DPR, is a South Korea-based independent music and visual arts collective 
                founded in 2014.Unlike traditional K-pop labels, DPR focuses on complete artistic freedom, combining music, visual 
                storytelling, and production under one creative roof. The collective is known for its unique and genre-blending 
                sound, paired with high-quality visuals and self-produced content.
                DPR was co-founded by DPR IAN (Christian Yu), a former K-pop idol turned director and artist. He plays a major role 
                in shaping the group's visual identity and music videos. Other key members include DPR CREAM, the main producer and 
                composer; DPR ARTIC, a DJ and electronic music artist; and DPR LIVE (Hong Da-bin), now going by DABIN, who was the 
                collective's frontman and is known for his smooth vocals and deep lyricism.
                The group gained international popularity through projects like Coming to You Live, Moodswings In This Order, and 
                large-scale world tours like The Regime Tour. DPR stands out for its “DIY” approach—writing, directing, producing,
                 and editing everything in-house—allowing them to express authentic, unfiltered creativity.
                As of 2025, DABIN is pursuing solo music under his new label CTYL, while IAN, CREAM, and ARTIC continue to represent
                 DPR globally through performances and new music. The collective's goal has always been to inspire artists to take control of their 
                own creative process, living by the motto: “Dream it. Perfect it. Regime it.”
            </p>
            <p>DPR is more than a label—it’s a creative movement where a group of artists build and express on their own terms. Combining visionary video art, independent music production, and global touring, they’re reshaping expectations in Korean music and beyond, while members continue evolving individually.</p>
